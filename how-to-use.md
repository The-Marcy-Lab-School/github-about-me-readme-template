## 📌 Why Create a GitHub Profile README?

When someone visits your GitHub profile, you can display a special `README.md`.  
This acts like your personal homepage inside GitHub.

A strong profile README:
- Gives context about **who you are** and what you care about.
- Highlights your **skills, tools, and projects** in a polished way.
- Creates a **great first impression** for employers, collaborators, or anyone stumbling upon your work.
- Let's you express a bit of your **personality and interests**, not just your code.

Think of it as your developer intro to the industry.
