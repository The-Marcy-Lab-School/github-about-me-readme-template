## Development Workflow

This project follows a **branch and merge workflow**:

- **Never push code directly to the main branch**
- Work on separate feature branches
- Create pull requests (PRs) for all changes
- **All PRs must be reviewed and merged by someone else, even on solo projects**
- Delete branches after successful merges

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/feature-name` for new features
- `fix/bug-description` for bug fixes
- `update/component-name` for updates
- `style/styling-changes` for styling updates

## Documentation Standards

### Inline Comments
- Document your code with clear, concise comments
- Label different parts of the code
- Describe what functions and files are for
- **Delete any commented-out code** before committing

### Commit Message Format
Use descriptive commit messages that start with:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `update:` for updates to existing functionality
- `style:` for styling changes
- `delete:` for removing code/files

**Examples:**
```
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve login validation bug
update: improve error handling in API calls
style: update navigation bar styling
delete: remove deprecated helper functions
```

## Project Management
